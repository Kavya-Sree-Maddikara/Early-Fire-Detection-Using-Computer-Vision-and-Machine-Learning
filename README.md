# Early-Fire-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision-and-Machine-Learning
This project presents a machine learning-based system for early fire detection using webcam video input and Python-based image processing. It leverages OpenCV, Haar cascades, and ADA Boost classifiers to detect fire and smoke. The report includes literature review, existing system limitations, and proposed vision-based approach for real-time fire alerting, with an emphasis on low-cost implementation and environmental adaptability.
